                <p>The following are things I currently like.</p>

                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Category</th>

                        <td>Movie</td>
                        <td>Shrek</td>
                        <td>I think it's a great satire and extremely funny (especially in Spanish)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Book</td>
                        <td>Educated</td>
                        <td>It's an extremely interesting page turner that shows the value of education.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Artist</td>
                        <td>Karol G</td>
                        <td>Her songs were my entire Summer playlist.</td>

            <h2>Future Goals</h2>

                <p>I am still deciding what my post-graduation life will look like. Ideally, I want to work for a couple of years and then go to graduate school.</p>

                <p>I'm interested in getting either an MBA in Business Analytics, or an MS in Data Science. However, during the Summer I built an app for my Internship project, and it got me interested in UI design. I decided to change my schedule and add this class to see if web design is something that I may be interested in for my career.</p>

                <p>I am excited to learn more about HTML and CSS! I've always been inclined to art and drawing, and this feels like a great combination of Computer Science and visual creativity.</p>
