                <h3>Ancient History</h3>

                <p>The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood, coupled with semi-isolation provided by deserts to the east and west, allowed for the development of one of the world's great civilizations in Egypt.</p>
                    
                <p>A unified kingdom arose circa <time datetime="-3200">3200 B.C.</time>, and a series of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last native dynasty fell to the Persians in <time datetime="-341">341 B.C.</time>, who in turn were replaced by the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines.</p>
                
                <p>Arab conquerors introduced Islam and the Arabic language in the 7th century and ruled for the next six centuries. The Mamluks, a local military caste, took control around <time datetime="1250">1250</time> and continued to govern after the Ottoman Turks conquered Egypt in <time datetime="1517">1517</time>.</p>

                <h3>British Rule</h3>
            
                <p>Completion of the Suez Canal in <time datetime="1869">1869</time> elevated Egypt as an important world transportation hub. Ostensibly to protect its investments, Britain seized control of Egypt's government in <time datetime="1882">1882</time>, but the country's nominal allegiance to the Ottoman Empire continued until <time datetime="1914">1914</time>.</p>
                        
                <p>Egypt gained partial independence from the UK in <time datetime="1922">1922</time> and full sovereignty in <time datetime="1952">1952</time>. British forces evacuated the Suez Canal Zone in <time datetime="1956">1956</time>.</p>

                <h3>Modern-day Issues</h3>
                
                <p>The completion of the Aswan High Dam in <time datetime="1971">1971</time> and the resultant Lake Nasser have reaffirmed the time-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing population (the largest in the Arab world), limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress society. The government has struggled to meet the demands of Egypt's fast-growing population as it implements large-scale infrastructure projects, energy cooperation, and foreign direct investment appeals.</p>
            
                <p>Inspired by the <time datetime="2010">2010</time> Tunisian revolution, Egyptian opposition groups led demonstrations and labor strikes countrywide, culminating in President Hosni Mubarak's ouster in <time datetime="2011">2011</time>. Egypt's military assumed national leadership until a new legislature was in place in early <time datetime="2012">2012</time>; later that same year, Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Morsi won the presidential election.</p>
            
                <p>Following protests throughout the spring of <time datetime="2013">2013</time> against MORSI's government and- the Muslim Brotherhood, the Egyptian Armed Forces intervened and removed Morsi from power in <time datetime="2013-07">July 2013</time> and replaced him with interim president Adly Mansour. Simultaneously, the government began enacting laws to limit freedoms of assembly and expression.</p>
                
                <p>In <time datetime="2014">2014</time>, voters approved a new constitution by referendum and then elected former defense minister Abdel Fattah El-Sisi president. El-Sisi was reelected to a second four-year term in <time datetime="2018">2018</time> and a third term in <time datetime="2023-12">December 2023</time>.</p>
